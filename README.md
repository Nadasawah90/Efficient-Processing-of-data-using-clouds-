### Overview

Correlation between gene expression profiles across multiple samples and the identification of inter-gene interactions is a critical technique for Co-expression networking. Due to the highly intensive processing of calculating the Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient, PCC, matrix, it often takes too much processing time to accomplish it. Therefore, in this work, Big Data techniques including MapReduce and Spark have been employed in a cloud environment to calculate the PCC matrix to find the dependencies between genes measured in high throughput microarray. A comparison between the running time of each phase in both of MapReduce and Spark approaches has been held. Both these techniques can dramatically speed up the computation allowing users to work with highly intensive processing. However, Spark has yielded a better performance than the MapReduce as it performs the processing in the main memory of the worker nodes and avoids the unnecessary I/O operations with the disks. Spark has yielded 80 times speed up for calculating the PCC of 22777 genes, however the MapReduce attained barely 8 times speed up.
### PCC 
The Pearson correlation coefficient is one of the most popular approaches in measuring the intensity of a linear association between two genes in a Gene Co-expression Network; hence, it has been applied here as a measure of dependencies between interacting genes. Let(X&Y) considered as a pair of gene expression profiles & (n) is the number of pairs in a gene expression data then the PCC can be calculated as PCC=(∑_(i=1)^n▒XY-  (∑_(i=1)^n▒X  ∑_(i=1)^n▒Y)/n   )/(√((∑_(i=1)^n▒〖X^2)-((∑_(i=1)^n▒X)^2/n) 〗) √((∑_(i=1)^n▒〖Y^2)-((∑_(i=1)^n▒Y)^2/n) 〗))

The computation of the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient between genes expressed in a gene expression matrix has a quadratic complexity. Therefore, we are suggesting here a parallel algorithm that will break the entire calculation of PCC matrix into components.
Each technique receives an input matrix comprising the gene expression values for each gene in different conditions, samples. These expression data are saved in a numeric matrix, with n columns, the number of genes, and m rows, the number of samples.
### MapReduce
consists of mappers which perform a large portion of work and reducers which perform a relatively small amount of computation which achieves the best performance. In the implementation of the Multithreaded Mapper implementation, threads from a thread pool invoke a queue of key value pairs in parallel. Multiple threads running a map task can help to speed up the tasks, based on availability of cores in the system. The map and shuffle task only receive a key-value pair input <k1, V1> and get outputs with other key-value pair in parallel. However, the reduce task receives the input from shuffle<K2, List<V2>> , which is a key and a list of values associated with that key. It get all this pairs of values associated with the i-th and j-th columns/variables and compute Pearson correlation. The output of the Reduce phase is (K3,V3) as the PCC between a pair of genes, the i-th and j-th genes. 

###Spark  
integrates the whole functionality in one program. This makes the tool easier to work with the users having only to launch the application once and avoid writing/reading from
disks because it is based on memory which makes it is faster than MapReduce. Spark uses a hybrid approach that combines MPI processes and threads. Each MPI process launches multiple threads to efficiently exploit the cores available on each node and to reduce the memory requirements. Regarding the workload distribution, as the PCC must be calculated for all gene pairs, the workload of this step can be represented with a 2D matrix, where both axes x and y include all genes. Further improvement in the performance of the proposed algorithm has been done by dividing the data into multiple partitions based on the number of threads and execute on available cores on multiple nodes and also only half of the matrix must be calculated Concretely  sum (i, i=1 to N) = N * (N + 1) / 2 which called triangular numbers   (Since  cor(A,B)=cor(B,A)) which  adding  more time for  saving. So, every pair of genes has been handled as a compute job, key them with a unique index, send to any compute unit available, and put them back into the result matrix using their key. 
###	Material 
The data employed in this research is a non-benchmarking  dataset for Liver cancer, Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC). It is a real data downloaded from GEO, Gene Expression Omnibus data bankand contains  thirty-five Microarray samples of HCC that have been downloaded from. These samples have been collected using the Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 platform. HCC is a complication of HCV (Hepatitis C virus) cirrhosis. The raw data has been preprocessed by the Affy package which is provided by the Bioconductor. 
### Platform
A cloud platform from IBM, IBM Analytics Engine, IAE has been utilized in this research. The IAE offers a parallel infrastructure for MapReduce and Spark on the IBM cloud. It permits users to upload their data in a layer called the IBM Cloud Object Storage and provides clusters of computing nodes to work on the uploaded data. The separation of the computing and storage layers helps in having more scalability and flexibility in analyzing. Analytics libraries and open-source packages has been employed.
